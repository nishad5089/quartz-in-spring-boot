== Quartz Enterprise Job Scheduler
:stylesheet: dark.css

 What is the Quartz Job Scheduling Library?

Quartz is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to
the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create
simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even
tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard Java
components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do.
The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as
support for JTA transactions and clustering.

// What Can Quartz Do For You?
//
//If your application has tasks that need to occur at given moments in time, or if your system has recurring maintenance jobs then Quartz may be your ideal solution.
//
//Sample uses of job scheduling with Quartz:
//
//* Driving Process Workflow: As a new order is initially placed, schedule a Job to fire in exactly 2 hours, that will check the status of that order, and trigger a warning notification if an order confirmation message has not yet been received for the order, as well as changing the order’s status to 'awaiting intervention'.
//
//* System Maintenance: Schedule a job to dump the contents of a database into an XML file every business day (all weekdays except holidays) at 11:30 PM.
//
//* Providing reminder services within an application.

=== Features
*Runtime Environments*

* Quartz can run embedded within another free standing application

* Quartz can be instantiated within an application server (or servlet container), and participate in XA transactions

* Quartz can run as a stand-alone program (within its own Java Virtual Machine), to be used via RMI

* Quartz can be instantiated as a cluster of stand-alone programs (with load-balance and fail-over capabilities) for the execution of jobs


=== Job Scheduling
Jobs are scheduled to run when a given Trigger occurs. Triggers can be created with nearly any combination of the following directives:

//Ultimate and Community both editions are available for IntelliJ IDEA.
//In this article developers will find some useful plugins to boost their development experience as well as most used keymaps to keep their hands mostly on the keyboard.
//
//== Useful IntelliJ IDEA Plugins
//
//- To generate boilerplate code (e.g. Getter, Setter and so on) during compile time
//https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok[Lombok, window=_blank] plugin is the best choice for the developers.
//It is very easy to use due to its annotation based code generation.
//- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[AsciiDoc, window=_blank] plugin brings Asciidoc supports for the developer.
//It helps to write the technical documentation easily on the same IDE they have used for the development.
//- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11058-extra-icons[Extra Icons, window=_blank] plugin helps to visually recognize different file formats almost instantly by their icons.
//- If you are struggling to find opening and closing brackets in your code, https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets[Rainbow Brackets, window=_blank] plugin may help you.
//It helps developers to find brackets through rainbow coloring.

//== Keymaps
//
//[TIP]
//====
//.Keymap learning and presentation plugins for IntelliJ IDEA
//- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x/versions[Key Promoter X] plugin shows a popup notification with the corresponding keyboard shortcut whenever a command executed using the mouse.
//It also shows most used keymap statistics.
